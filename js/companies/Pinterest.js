/**
 * Just interviewed with Pinterest.
 * Solving a leetcode medium took me 45 min compared to typical 5-15min in a contest.
 *
 * I spent time writing tests, asking about the domain a bit to choose better names for types,
 * functions and variables, explaining my design and data structure choices
 * (pretty much every line), adding "const" whenever appropriate, using long meaningful names
 * instead of i/j/n etc.
